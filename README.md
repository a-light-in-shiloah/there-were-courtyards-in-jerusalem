__There were courtyards in Jerusalem__ built over the virgin rock and below them a hollow was made lest there might be a grave in the depths, and pregnant women were brought and bore their children there, and there they reared them. And oxen were brought, and on their backs were laid doors on top of which sat the children with cups of stone in their hands. When they arrived in Shiloah the children alighted, and filled the cups with water, and mounted, and again sat on the doors

What? 

That's what happened in the bible. 

If they found a cow that was a certain color and perfect, they had to find some pregnant women to a specially built house, and then they had their children and their children were raised in that house in isolation in case they ever came in contact with a dead body, and those children were the only ones who could carry these bowls of water.

That's real.

Isn't that fucked up?

That's Christianity. 

I don't get it 

In the last 4,000 years there have only been 9 cows that were perfect enough. And there are people looking for the tenth, because unless they find it they can never rebuild a place to sacrifice this cow.

Well...  They didn't know..  

Honestly,  different time,  different ethics 

People still believe this now

My parents believe this.

Omg

Thats actuslly cool 

All Jews believe this. This is why they are fighting for Israel, this is why 9/11 happened, this is why America was founded.

That's why we have universities. 

You r joking 

No I'm not.

Jews have been trying to find this cow, and a whole religion was built around it. That religion led to Christianity.

This cow 

Which led to the fall of the Roman Empire, and eventually to the reformation, and that led to people becoming Protestants, who had to flee to America. 

Muslims don't want us to find the cow, because they will be destroyed by God. 

That's why they want to kill all the Jews. 

To prevent them from finding this cow.

Christianity was well established when Mohamed arose around 600 years later. So everyone around Israel had been hearing for hundreds of years that as soon as the next red cow appeared, there would be a mighty fire from the sky to obliterate Israel's enemies. 

Mohamed grew up as one person in an isolated area surrounded by Christians. This is why Muslims are mad at Christians. Because Christians have been telling them for 2,000 years, that as soon as we find that cow, you are fucked.

This is going to bring about the unification of the world, the near total destruction and our eventual ascension to the heavens (to outer space).

That is the story of a man, and a cow.

That's what Christians believe.
